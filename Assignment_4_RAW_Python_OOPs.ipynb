    "Theory Questions:- Python OOPs\n",
    "Definition\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of “objects”, which can contain data (attributes) and\n",
    "code (methods).\n",
    "It focuses on organizing software into reusable, modular pieces instead of writing code in a linear (procedural) way.\n",
    "Key Concepts of OOP\n",
    "1. Class → Blueprint/template for creating objects.\n",
    "2. Object → Instance of a class (real-world entity).\n",
    "3. Encapsulation → Binding data and methods together in a single unit.\n",
    "4. Abstraction → Hiding unnecessary details and showing only the essential features.\n",
    "5. Inheritance → One class can acquire properties and methods of another class.\n",
    "6. Polymorphism → Ability to use the same interface with different forms (method overriding & overloading).\n",
    "Example in Python\n",
    "# Class (Blueprint)\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__ (self, brand, model):\n",
    "        self.brand = brand   # Attribute\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "    def display_info (self):   # Method\n",
    "        return f\"Car: {self.brand} {self.model}\"\n",
    "# Object (Instance of Class)\n",
    "car1 = Car (\"Tesla\", \"Model S\" )\n",
    "car2 = Car (\"BMW\", \"X5\")\n",
    "print(car1.display_info ())   # Output Car: Tesla Model S\n",
    "print(car2.display_info ())   # Output Car: BMW X5Q1. What is Object-Oriented Programming(OOP)?\n",
    "A class in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a blueprint or template that defines how to create objects.\n",
    "It describes the attributes (data/properties) and methods (functions/behaviors) that the objects of that class will have.\n",
    "Key Points about Classes:\n",
    "1. Blueprint Concept\n",
    "Think of a class as a design/plan.\n",
    "Example: An architect draws a blueprint of a house →  but the actual house is built later.\n",
    "2. Objects are Instances\n",
    "Objects are real, usable things created from the class.\n",
    "Example: If Car is a class (blueprint), then Tesla or BMW are actual objects (real cars).\n",
    "3. Encapsulation of Data + Behavior\n",
    "Classes combine attributes (variables) and methods (functions) into one unit.\n",
    "Example: A Car has attributes like brand, model and methods like start() , brake() .\n",
    "4. Reusability\n",
    "Once a class is defined, you can create multiple objects without rewriting code.Q2. What is a Class in OOP?27/08/2025, 10:04 Assignment-4(Python OOPs ).ipynb - Colab\n",

    "\n",
    "Example: From one Car class, you can create car1, car2, car3 easily.\n",
    "Example in Python:\n",
    "# Defining a class\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    # Constructor (__init__) to initialize attributes\n",
    "    def __init__ (self, brand, model):\n",
    "        self.brand = brand      # attribute (variable)\n",
    "        self.model = model      # attribute (variable)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Method (function inside class)\n",
    "    def display_info (self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.brand} {self.model}\"\n",
    "# Creating objects (instances of the class)\n",
    "car1 = Car (\"Tesla\", \"Model S\" )\n",
    "car2 = Car (\"BMW\", \"X5\")\n",
    "# Using object methods\n",
    "print(car1.display_info ())  # Output: Tesla Model S\n",
    "print(car2.display_info ())  # Output: BMW X5\n",
    "An object in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a real-world entity or an instance of a class.\n",
    "It represents something that has state (data/attributes) and behavior (methods/functions).\n",
    "Key Points about Objects:\n",
    "1. Instance of a Class\n",
    "A class is like a blueprint, and an object is the actual product created from that blueprint.\n",
    "Example: If Car is a class, then Tesla Model S  or BMW X5 are objects.\n",
    "2. Has State and Behavior\n",
    "State (attributes/variables): Describes the properties of the object.\n",
    "e.g., color = red , speed = 120 .\n",
    "Behavior (methods/functions): Describes what the object can do.\n",
    "e.g., drive() , brake() .\n",
    "3. Multiple Objects from One Class\n",
    "You can create many objects from the same class, each with its own data.\n",
    "Example: car1, car2, car3 all come from the Car class but can have different brands and models.\n",
    "Example in Python:\n",
    "# Class definition\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__ (self, brand, color):\n",
    "        self.brand = brand      # attribute\n",

    "    \n",
    "    def drive(self):            # method\n",
    "        return f\"{self.brand} car is driving!\"\n",

    "Both Abstraction and Encapsulation are key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).\n",
    "They sound similar but serve different purposes.\n",
    "1. Abstraction\n",
    "Definition:\n",
    "Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.\n",
    "Focus:What an object does (not how it does it).\n",
    "Achieved by:\n",
    "Abstract classes\n",
    "Interfaces\n",
    "Example in Real Life:\n",
    "When you drive a car, you only know about the steering wheel, accelerator, brakes (essential features).\n",
    "You don’t need to know the complex implementation of the engine or gear mechanism.\n",
    "2. Encapsulation\n",
    "Definition:\n",
    "Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data (attributes) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class).\n",
    "It also restricts direct access to some data using access modifiers (private , protected , public).\n",
    "Focus:How the data is hidden/protected.\n",
    "Achieved by:\n",
    "Using classes\n",
    "Access modifiers (_protected , __private ) in Python\n",
    "Example in Real Life:\n",
    "A capsule medicine wraps several ingredients inside one capsule shell.\n",
    "You don’t see or touch the ingredients directly.\n",
    "Tabular Difference:\n",
    "Feature Abstraction Encapsulation\n",

    "Dunder methods (short for “Double UNDERSCORE”) are special methods in Python.\n",
    "They always start and end with double underscores like __init__ , __str__ , __len__ .\n",
    "Also called magic methods because they add extra functionality to classes and objects.\n",
    "Purpose of Dunder Methods:\n",
    "To make classes behave like built-in types.\n",
    "To customize operators (like +, -, <, etc.) for user-defined classes.\n",
    "To define object creation, representation, comparison, arithmetic, etc.\n",
    "Commonly Used Dunder Methods:\n",
    "Dunder Method Purpose\n",
    "__init__ Constructor →  Initializes an object.\n",
    "__str__ Returns a string representation of the object (used with print() ).\n",
    "__repr__ Official representation of the object (useful for debugging).\n",
    "__len__ Defines behavior for len(obj) .\n",
    "__add__ Defines behavior for + operator.\n",
    "__eq__ Defines behavior for == operator.\n",
    "__getitem__ Defines behavior for indexing obj[i].\n",
    "__call__ Makes an object callable like a function.\n",
    "Example in Python\n",
    "class Book:\n",

    "Inheritance is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concept where a class (child/derived class) can reuse the properties and\n",
    "methods of another class (parent/base class).\n",
    "It allows code reusability and represents an “is-a” relationship between classes.\n",
    "Key Points:\n",
    "1. The child class inherits data members (variables) and methods (functions) from the parent class.\n",
    "2. The child class can:\n",
    "Use parent class features as they are.\n",
    "Override parent methods to change behavior.\n",
    "Add new methods or attributes of its own.\n",
    "3. Helps in writing clean, reusable, and maintainable code.\n",
    "Types of Inheritance in Python:\n",
    "1. Single Inheritance → One child inherits from one parent.\n",
    "2. Multiple Inheritance → A child inherits from more than one parent.\n",
    "3. Multilevel Inheritance → A child inherits from a parent, which in turn inherits from another class.\n",
    "4. Hierarchical Inheritance → Multiple child classes inherit from the same parent.\n",
    "5. Hybrid Inheritance → Combination of multiple inheritance types.\n",
    "Example in Python\n",
    "# Parent Class\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",

    "Definition:\n",
    "The word Polymorphism comes from Greek:\n",
    "Poly = many\n",
    "Morph = forms\n",
    "In OOP, Polymorphism means the ability of different classes to respond to the same method name in different ways.\n",
    "It allows a single function, operator, or method to have multiple implementations.\n",
    "Key Idea:\n",
    "One interface, multiple implementations.\n",
    "The exact behavior depends on the object that is calling the method.\n",
    "Types of Polymorphism in Python:\n",
    "1. Compile-time Polymorphism (Overloading)Q7. What is Polymorphism in OOP?27/08/2025, 10:04 Assignment-4(Python OOPs ).ipynb - Colab\n",

    "\n",
    "Having multiple methods with the same name but different arguments.\n",
    "Note: Python doesn’t support traditional overloading, but we can achieve similar behavior using default arguments or *args.\n",
    "2. Run-time Polymorphism (Overriding)\n",
    "When a child class provides its own implementation of a method already defined in the parent class.\n",
    "Example 1: Method Overriding (Run-time Polymorphism)\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",

    "Definition Recap:\n",
    "Encapsulation = wrapping up data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class).\n",
    "It also helps in restricting direct access to data by using access modifiers.\n",
    "Ways to Achieve Encapsulation in Python:\n",
    "1. Using Classes\n",
    "Class binds data (attributes) and methods together.\n",
    "Example: A Car class containing both speed and drive() .\n",
    "2. Access Modifiers in Python\n",
    "Python does not have strict private/protected keywords like Java or C++,\n",

    "Definition:\n",
    "A constructor in Python is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created.\n",
    "Its main job is to initialize the attributes (data members) of the object.\n",
    "In Python:\n",
    "The constructor method is always written as:\n",
    "def __init__ (self, arguments ):\n",
    "    # initialization code\n",
    "Note :- __init__  is a dunder method (double underscore )\n",
    "        self parameter refers to the current instance of the class\n",
    "### Example 1: Simple Constructor\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Student:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):  # constructor\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "# Creating objects\n",
    "s1 = Student(\"Ritesh\", 21)\n",

    "print(s1.name, s1.age)  # Output: Ritesh 21\n",
    "print(s2.name, s2.age)  # Output: Aditi 20\n",
    "Example 2: Default Constructor\n",
    "If no constructor is defined, Python provides a default constructor automatically.\n",
    "e.g:\n",
    "class Demo:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "obj = Demo ()  # Default constructor is called\n",
    "Example 3: Constructor with Default Arguments\n",
    "class Car:\n",

    "c2 = Car ()   # Uses default value\n",
    "print(c1.brand )  # BMW\n",
    "print(c2.brand )  # Toyota\n",
    "Key Points:\n",
    "1. __init__ method = constructor in Python.\n",
    "2. It initializes object attributes at creation time.\n",
    "3. Python automatically calls it when you create an object.\n",
    "4. We can use default arguments to make constructors flexible.\n",
    "1. Class Methods\n",
    "A class method is a method that is bound to the class itself, not the object.\n",
    "It can access and modify class-level attributes (shared across all objects).\n",
    "Defined using the @classmethod  decorator.\n",
    "The first parameter is always cls (refers to the class).\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "class Student :\n",
    "    school = \"ABC Public School\"    # Class attribute\n",
    "    def __init__ (self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def change_school (cls, new_school ):\n",
    "        cls.school = new_school   # modifies class-level data\n",
    "# Using class method\n",
    "Student.change_school (\"XYZ International School\" )\n",
    "print(Student.school )  # Output: XYZ International School\n",
    "2. Static Methods\n",
    "A static method does not depend on the class (cls) or instance (self).\n",
    "Used when we want a utility/helper function inside a class.\n",
    "Defined using the @staticmethod  decorator.\n",

    "5. Abstraction\n",
    "Only essential details are shown, while complex implementation is hidden.\n",
    "Helps in reducing complexity.\n",
    "6. Maintainability\n",
    "OOP code is easier to update, modify, and maintain because each class is independent.\n",
    "7. Scalability\n",
    "Large projects can be managed efficiently as OOP makes it easier to divide work into modules (classes).\n",
    "Example (Real-Life Analogy)\n",
    "Think of a Car class:\n",
    "Properties: color, model, engine_type\n",

    "Polymorphism means \"many forms\".\n",

    "1. How Polymorphism Works with Inheritance\n",
    "A parent class defines a method.\n",
    "Child classes override (redefine) that method with their own behavior.\n",
    "When we call the method on different objects, Python automatically decides which version to execute (based on the object type).\n",
